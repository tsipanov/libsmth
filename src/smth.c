This is to document thouroughly the internals of libsmth. Note that only
internal developers should read this. If you simply wish to link against
this lib, you may want to check out \c README.

\section beta Brief introduction to Smooth Streaming key concepts

\subsection anna Packet (Box) structure

Each \c Fragment contains a chunk of audio, video or text data, with a
metadata header. Each functional block of the fragment was named \c Box.
Each \c Box has a fixed structure:

\verbatim
~-----------+------+-----------------+------------+-------------~
~ BoxLenght | Name | [BoxLongLenght] | BoxFields  | BoxChildren ~
~    4B     |  4B  |  8B (optional)  | {variable} |  {variable} ~
~-----------+------+-----------------+------------+-------------~
\endverbatim

where:

\li \c Length     is the length of the box in bytes, encoded in network format.
                  If the value of the field is 1, the BoxLongLength
                  field must be present. Otherwise, we assert that it is not
                  present. Size includes all the fields, even BoxLenght itself.
\li \c Name       is a 4B non null-terminated string identifying the type of
                  the block. There are seven different types, as it will be
                  explained in the appropriate section.
\li \c LongLenght is the length of the Box in bytes, encoded in network format. 
                  This field is present only if the size of the \c Box is larger
                  than BoxLenght max size (32B).

\li \c Fields&Children are respectively the attributes and the content of the
                       \c Box and may vary accordingly to the role of the
                       respective \c Box.

The syntax of each \c Box is a strict subset of the syntax of the respective
Fragment Box defined in [\c ISOFF].

\subsection bebba Fragment Structure

As stated before, a Fragment Response is composed of various \c Boxes,

\verbatim
~------------+------------~
~   MoofBox  |  MdatBox   ~
~ {variable} | {variable} ~
~------------+------------~
\endverbatim

Each \c Box must contain certain sub-Boxes, and it may contain others.
Any block may contain one or more \c VendorExtensionUUIDBox, as described later.

\subsection cedda Manifest Response

According to the specifications, the Manifest must be a Well-Formed \c XML
Document subject to the following constraints:

\li The Document's \c XML Declaration's major version is \c 1.
\li The Documentâ€™s \c XML Declaration's minor version is \c 0.
\li The Document does not use a Document Type Definition (\c DTD).
\li The Document uses an encoding that is supported by the Client.
\li The XML Elements specified in this document do not use \c XML Namespaces.
