/*
 * 1. Packet (`Box`) structure
 * ===========================
 *
 * Each `Fragment` contains a chunk of audio, video or text data, with a
 * metadata header. Each functional block of the fragment was named `Box`.
 * Each `Box` has a fixed structure:
 *
 *    ~-----------+------+-----------------+------------+-------------~
 *    ~ BoxLenght | Name | [BoxLongLenght] | BoxFields  | BoxChildren ~
 *    ~    4B     |  4B  |  8B (optional)  | {variable} |  {variable} ~
 *    ~-----------+------+-----------------+------------+-------------~
 *
 * where:
 *  + `Length`     is the length of the box in bytes, encoded in network format.
 *                 If the value of the field is 1, the BoxLongLength
 *                 field must be present. Otherwise, we assert that it is not
 *                 present. Size includes all the fields, even BoxLenght itself.
 *  + `Name`       is a 4B non null-terminated string identifying the type of
 *                 the block. There are seven different types, as it will be
 *                 explained in the appropriate section.
 *  + `LongLenght` is the length of the Box in bytes, encoded in network format. 
 *                 This field is present only if the size of the `Box` is larger
 *                 than BoxLenght max size (32B).
 *  + `Fields` &   are respectively the attributes and the content of the `Box`
 *    `Children`   and may vary accordingly to the role of the respective `Box`.
 *
 * The syntax of each `Box` is a strict subset of the syntax of the respective
 * Fragment Box defined in [ISOFF].
 *
 * 2. Fragment Structure
 * =====================
 *
 * As stated before, a Fragment Response is composed of various `Boxes`,
 *
 *  ~------------+------------~
 *  ~   MoofBox  |  MdatBox   ~
 *  ~ {variable} | {variable} ~
 *  ~------------+------------~
 *
 * Each `Box` must contain certain sub-Boxes, and it may contain others.
 * Any block may contain one or more `VendorExtensionUUIDBox`, as described later.
 *
 * 3. Manifest Response
 * ====================
 *
 * According to the specifications, the Manifest must be a Well-Formed XML
 * Document subject to the following constraints:
 *
 *   +The Document's XML Declaration's major version is 1.
 *   +The Documentâ€™s XML Declaration's minor version is 0.
 *   +The Document does not use a Document Type Definition (DTD).
 *   +The Document uses an encoding that is supported by the Client.
 *   +The XML Elements specified in this document do not use XML Namespaces.
